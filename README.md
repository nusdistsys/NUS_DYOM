# NUS DYOM

This is a catalogue of all past and present School of Computing NUS Design Your Own Module(DYOM)s that have been run in NUS.

## Motivation

We realized that it was cumbersome to relay resources which would otherwise be lost in time. We hope that this repository will:

- Ease the process of organizing DYOMs in the future by providing a curated list of resources.
- Encourage people to organize DYOMs by letting them know that this has been done before.

Each DYOM could have a link to its own README/repository.

## List of DYOMs

### Community

@TODO {Joel} Perhaps link to NUS Hackers Chat and/or set up a gitter. I suspect NUS Hackers chat would make more sense.
