# NUS DYOM

This is a catalogue of all past and present School of Computing NUS Design Your Own Module(DYOM)s that have been run in NUS.

## Motivation

We realized that it was cumbersome to relay resources which would otherwise be lost in time. We hope that this repository will:

- Ease the process of organizing DYOMs in the future by providing a curated list of resources.
- Encourage people to organize DYOMs by letting them know that this has been done before.

Each DYOM could have a link to its own README/repository.

## How to start a DYOM (in SoC?)

### Relevant doc:
https://www.nus.edu.sg/registrar/academic-information-policies/undergraduate-students/design-your-own-module

### Rought Sketch of what you'd need to do:

1. Draft a plan with module outline. This should include topics covered, learning outcomes, and how this differs from existing modules in NUS. The grading criteria is less important because it is pass/fail.
2. Gather at least ten people to take the module with oyu
3. Find a supervisor -- this is typically a NUS Staff. You can reach out to professors you know or professors who are working in a research area related to the topics covered in the DYOM
4. Submit a proposal on myEduRec before due date(for sem 1 this is 20th July)
5. Before the semester(approx) head to MyEduRec and upload the names of the ten people who are doing the DYOM with you
6. At the end of the semester submit documentation logging who passed and who failed as well as supporting documentation(if any)
